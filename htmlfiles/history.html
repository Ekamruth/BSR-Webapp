  <h4 id="heading">HISTORY OF ELECTRICITY</h4>
  <p>
    Electricity is a greatest naturally generated source of energy which was experienced practically by Benjamin Franklin in the 1700s with his kite experiment, in which he flew a kite with a metal key tied to it during a thunderstorm. Exactly after 131 years Michael Faraday invented the dynamo in which pressure creates a energy in the form of light and it is later on called as electricity. In the last few centuries electricity has transformed the lives of the individual to a new phase and the journey of the same has reached almost to every house by today.<br>

At first, electricity was associated with light. People wanted a cheap and safe way to light their homes, and scientists thought electricity might be a way. Learning how to produce and use electricity was not easy. For a long time, there was no dependable source of electricity for experiments. Most of the nation's electricity was generated by natural gas, nuclear energy, and coal in 2020. Electricity is also produced from renewable sources such as wind, hydropower, solar power, biomass, wind, and geothermal.</p>

<p>In India, power is generated from conventional (Thermal, Nuclear & Hydro) and renewable sources (Wind, Solar, Biomass etc.). However, Major production of electricity is achieved through coal a thermal power plant which is around 75% of the total power generation.
After the invention of the electricity storage and transmission has become a challenge till 1855. That challenge was overcome with the invention of transformer by Otto Blathy and Karoly Zipernowsky where they prioritised the transformation of high electrical energy from one circuit to another through the process of electromagnetic induction, which helped us to get the electricity to every home.
